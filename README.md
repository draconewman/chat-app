# chat-app
A multi-client chat application consisting of both client and server programs. In this chat application simultaneously several clients can communicate with each other. 
The client programs send the chat text or image (input) to the server and then the server distributes that message (text or image) to all the other clients. 
Each client then displays the message sent to it by the server. The server handles several clients concurrently. 
It works fine as clients come and go. Clients are able to send messages in the following two modes - 
```
(i) Unicast
(ii) Broadcast

Languages used: HTML, CSS, JS
Frameworks used: Node.js, Socket.IO
```
